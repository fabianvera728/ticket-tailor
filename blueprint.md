# **App Name**: Ticket Tailor

## Core Features:

- Prompt Analyzer: Analyze the input prompt to identify and extract variable placeholders (e.g., {{MODULE_NAME}}).
- Dynamic Form Generator: Generate a form with input fields corresponding to the extracted variables, allowing the user to input the required parameters.  It is designed as a tool: based on the user prompt the right fields must be presented.
- Ticket Constructor: Construct the final ticket using the original prompt as a template and substituting user inputs into the identified variable placeholders.
- Copy to Clipboard: Enable users to copy the complete generated ticket to the clipboard.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) for a professional and technical feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for interactive elements and the 'Copy' button, providing a clear visual cue.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, for clear readability.
- Use simple, clear icons from a library like Material Icons to represent form fields and actions.
- A clean, single-column layout optimized for readability and ease of use, with distinct sections for each stage of ticket creation.
- Subtle transitions when generating the form and when constructing the ticket to provide visual feedback to the user.
